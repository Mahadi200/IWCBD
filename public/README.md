# Public Directory

This directory contains static assets that are served directly by the web server.

## Files:

- `robots.txt` - Search engine crawler instructions
- `manifest.json` - Web app manifest for PWA functionality
- `favicon.ico` - Website favicon (add your own)
- `icon-192x192.png` - App icon for mobile devices (add your own)
- `icon-512x512.png` - App icon for mobile devices (add your own)

## Adding Images:

Place any images, icons, or other static assets in this directory. They will be accessible from the root of your website.

Example:
- `public/logo.png` → accessible as `/logo.png`
- `public/images/hero-bg.jpg` → accessible as `/images/hero-bg.jpg`

## Icons Needed:

For a complete setup, you'll need to add:
1. `favicon.ico` - 16x16, 32x32, 48x48 pixels
2. `icon-192x192.png` - 192x192 pixels
3. `icon-512x512.png` - 512x512 pixels
4. `apple-touch-icon.png` - 180x180 pixels (for iOS)
